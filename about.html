        I’m a builder at heart — I like breaking down complex workflows, designing smart systems, and making apps that feel great to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Victaulic, I work on full-stack applications that support logistics and manufacturing teams around the world. I’ve helped refactor legacy codebases into modular, scalable services using Angular, NestJS, TypeORM, and Azure — and I’ve loved mentoring interns and junior devs along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        What keeps me engaged isn’t just writing clean code — it’s finding leverage. Whether that’s automating a deployment, smoothing out a team process, or simplifying a UI, I’m always looking for ways to make systems (and people) work better together.
      </p>

        Outside of work, I’m into fitness, gaming (especially RPGs and optimization), and long-term financial planning. I recently moved to Jersey City with my wife and am currently working toward homeownership and growing into a leadership role in tech.
